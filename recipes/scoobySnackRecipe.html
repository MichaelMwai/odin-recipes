        Scooby Snacks (occasionally spelled Scooby Snax) are a fictional snack food that appear in Scooby-Doo. In the show, they are often used as an incentive by Fred, Daphne, and Velma to convince Scooby-Doo and Shaggy to participate in dangerous or frightening schemes, such as acting as bait for a monster. Shaggy and Scooby will generally refuse at first, with one of the other characters convincing them by saying, "Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?"

        You’ll use a variety of ingredients that you’re used to seeing in any and all baking recipes, but a few notes about the ingredients more unique to this recipe.
      </p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour – you can use a regular ap flour, or a gluten free baking flour</li>
        <li>Oatmeal – I would suggest grinding up the oats to make an oat flour</li>
        <li>Butter – you’ll need one stick, or 8 tablespoons (salted or unsalted is ok)</li>
        <li>Sugar – these cookies aren’t overly sweet, so feel free to add a little extra</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder – this is what gives the color the yummy chocolate brown color</li>
        <li>Eggs – regular large eggs are used in this cookie recipe</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract – I like using a good quality vanilla extract like <a href="https://amzn.to/3nQGJzR">this one</a>.</li>
        <li>Walnut extract – the most unique ingredient that gives the cookies a nice nutty flavor, I just buy one off Amazon</li>
      </ul>
